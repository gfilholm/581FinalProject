Upload experimental data into this folder. The process.py script loads the data and creates the model and objective funciton. 
We can calculate the gradient objective (used for line search) analytically for a dampend harmonic oscillator. 

After running run_fit.py, points of the fitted curve will populate into the folder in a .csv file.
