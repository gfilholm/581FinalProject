# 581FinalProject
Final Project for PHYS 581.


This repo contains non-linear data fitting optimizers (conjugate gradient method, gradient decent, and BFGS) with line searches (Armijo and Stong Wolfe conditions).

We use pixi for version control, and mystmd to run a documentation server. 


To open the doc server, first run

```{code-block} python
pixi shell
```

then run the following code:

```{code-block} python
myst start --execute
```
